I have noticed a worrying tendency for management to place family members in key positions. This has fostered an environment of nepotism and favoritism, thereby stifling genuine career advancement opportunities for other dedicated employees. Moreover, it has led to a systemic bias in hiring practices, where qualified candidates often face unusually prolonged processes while preference seems to be given to candidates with personal connections within the company. During my time at Yardi Systems, I was consistently subjected to harassment and belittlement by the leadership. This involved unfair workload distribution, regular derogatory remarks about my work and capability, and unwarranted negative commentary about me among the team. When I attempted to address these issues, I was met with retaliation rather than understanding and resolution. Unfortunately, I also experienced discrimination as I perceived there to be double standards for employees not related to or connected with the leadership team. These included higher expectations and standards applied inconsistently across the workforce. I feel let down by both the company and its HR department, as my experiences and observations were never adequately addressed. Despite the challenges I have faced, I sincerely hope for the company to acknowledge these systemic issues and make significant changes in its management practices and workplace culture for the sake of future employees.

In an era where companies strive to create a healthy, transparent, and engaging work culture, Yardi seems to be lost in the past. From the onset, it was clear that the company lacks an environment conducive to socialization and peer bonding. There are no perks, no team building activities, no fun Fridays. It's work, and only work, from start to finish. The lack of these benefits has created a robotic atmosphere that leaves much to be desired, especially considering the high-stress nature of the job. A major downside at Yardi is the lack of transparency. The company operates on a need-to-know basis, which makes it hard to feel part of a cohesive team. The secretive culture is not conducive to trust-building or fostering a sense of belonging among employees. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to invest emotionally in your work or feel genuinely connected to the company's mission. The company's approach to software development is equally disappointing. If you're looking for a place to grow as a developer and work on exciting, cutting-edge projects, Yardi may not be the place for you. Much of the work involves replicating old code and patching up bugs\u2014often ones that originated from outsourced teams. Innovation and creativity are not nurtured here, and it feels as if we are stuck in a loop of copy-pasting rather than progressing. This can severely limit career growth, as the skills you develop here are not on par with industry standards. The heavy reliance on outdated coding practices could render you irrelevant and unhireable in the broader job market. It's disheartening to see your skillset stagnate in a field that is defined by constant evolution and learning. All in all, my experience at Yardi has been far from ideal.

My first role involved working remotely in Huntsville at corporate HQ for a customer located in another city. I had a great supervisor that I really got along with. Work was very interesting - I would\u2019ve liked to have continued this work, but I had to change roles for reasons that aren\u2019t relevant to my review. My second role was a different experience - although the work was boring, the job was easy, low stress, and the pay was good. Unfortunately I had a customer that was hands-off and MIA whilst taking maximum advantage of teleworking for two years during the COVID pandemic. I also frequently witnessed my supervisor angrily lashing out at different members of the team with insults/verbal abuse (mostly directed at my team-lead, and never directed at me personally). Even witnessed him slamming phones in close proximity, which made me uncomfortable to say the least. To be fair, he was under a lot of pressure to deliver analysis results and briefings with little-to-no notice from customers. I got along with my coworkers and immediate management for the most part, but much of their political and religious tirades really bothered me. I often heard fundamentalist \u201cChristian\u201d bible-thumping, bigoted, homophobic, hyper-partisan remarks. Some of it from i3 personnel, some of it also from non-i3 contractors on our team. I tried to steer the conversations away from that toxic rhetoric when possible, but it was a challenge. Sometimes I would walk into the lab and feel as though church was in session (with the typical hateful, un-Jesus like Alabama values being preached). One person (a non-i3 employee, but someone with whom I interacted on a daily basis) said what I regarded to be one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever heard - they said that the wildfires in California were God\u2019s \u201cjudgement\u201d on the people for their \u201cwicked ways\u201d. I was stunned when I heard this, but this is just one example of the kinds of things I frequently heard. That said, I felt the team really did care for my well-being, and I cared for them as well. I felt so conflicted at times because I really disagreed them, but at the same time I wanted to find more areas of agreement in order to better get along with them. Bottom line - i3 is overall a great company, but be careful if you accept a position onsite at Redstone Arsenal. If, like me, you dislike hearing and engaging in divisive religious and political rhetoric, then you may want to stick to roles at corporate HQ. I felt like the setting at HQ was much more professional and tame. I had an overall positive experience at i3, and really didn\u2019t want to leave.
